- Proper use of mocking frameworks (Mockito)
- Test cases cover both positive and negative scenarios
- Clear test method naming and organization
- Appropriate use of assertions

### Satisfactory (1.5-2 marks)
- Basic test coverage of main functionality
- Some use of mocking frameworks
- Limited scenario coverage
- Basic assertions implemented

### Poor (0-1 marks)
- Minimal or no test coverage
- Incorrect use of testing frameworks
- Missing critical test scenarios
- Poor test organization

## 3. Project Documentation and Time Management (3 marks)
### Documentation Excellence (1.5 marks)

    estimatedHours=8,
    actualHours=10,
    completionDate="2025-01-15"
)
public class AuthenticationService {
    // Implementation
}
```
